Weather Forecast Application [Java]
Overview

This project is a simple weather forecast application built in Java.
It allows users to input an address (or zip code) and view the current weather forecast.
The results are displayed via a user interface (UI), and recent results are cached to improve performance.

Requirements Implemented

✅ Built entirely in Java.

✅ Accepts an address or zip code as input.

✅ Retrieves forecast data for the given zip code (including current temperature, highs/lows, and extended forecast if available).

✅ Displays forecast details to the user via a UI.

✅ Caches forecast results for 30 minutes for subsequent requests with the same zip code.

✅ Displays an indicator in the UI if data is retrieved from the cache.
